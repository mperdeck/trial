Thanks for you response. However, your suggestion doesn't seem to be working.

I cleared the cache using
npm cache clean --force

Installed webpack and webpack-cli locally
npm install webpack
npm install webpack-cli

Ran webpack from the command line, with the same result. It still keeps asking if I want to install webpack-cli.

Full session:
